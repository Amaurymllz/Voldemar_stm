This repository is used to publish our app linked to the project 'Voldemar'. This project is made for a frensh engineering contest in 2024 called 'les Olympiades de Sciences de l'ingénieur' made by high school students. 
The students are Léa ROGER-LIM, Soren SAMAMA, Haris MESSAOUDI and Amaury MALLEZ. 

# The project
Our projet is a model of the Boeing-Bell v-22 osprey, which mean that he can take off vertically and then fligh like a plane. This specifity allow it to fligh for a long time, and still take off easily anywhere, without any need of human action.
 - Allow people to send a drone to follow a hiking trail in order to film it and check it's condition. 
 - Once the drone came back, the app will be able to analyse the video with an IA to tell if the hiking trail is passable, and if not, where it's blocked
 - The user is also able to watch (and keep) the whole video, at a normal speed or up to 10x the speed (to win time)
 - The drone will also be able to be driven by hand by any user, if they have a special place to film, or just want to have fun with it!
 - It is a 3d printed drone, which mean it can be modified quickly and easily. 

## Installation 
Download the repository then unzip the file and execute the file voldemar_video_reader_[Version]_[architecture].msix in the first repository. 
Then the app should be installed and you just have to launch it!

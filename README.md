This repository is used to publish our app associated with the ‘Voldemar’ project. This project is designed for a French engineering contest in 2024 called ‘les Olympiades de Sciences de l’ingénieur’, carried out by high school students. The students are Léa ROGER-LIM, Soren SAMAMA, Haris MESSAOUDI, and Amaury MALLEZ.

# The Project
Our project is a model of the Boeing-Bell V-22 Osprey, which means it can take off vertically and then fly like a plane. This feature allows it to fly for a long time and take off easily anywhere, without any need for human intervention.
- Allows people to send a drone to follow a hiking trail in order to film it and check its condition.
- Once the drone returns, the app will be able to analyze the video with AI to determine if the hiking trail is passable, and if not, where it’s blocked.
- The user is also able to watch (and keep) the entire video, at a normal speed or up to 10x the speed (to save time).
- The drone will also be able to be manually controlled by any user, if they have a special place to film, or just want to have fun with it!
- It is a 3D printed drone, which means it can be modified quickly and easily.

## Installation
Download the repository then unzip the file and execute the file voldemar_video_reader_[Version]_[architecture].msix in the first repository. Then the app should be installed and you just have to launch it! If you encounter any problems, post a message in the discussion tab.
